Officers Nicholas Lietz and Ronald Godfrey were assigned as a plain-clothes unit, driving an unmarked pick-up truck, when they attempted to stop Joseph Buckman, who was suspected of being involved in a hand to hand narcotics transacton.  As Mr. Buckman left in a vehicle from the Speedway, 11301 Westport Road, he fled on I-265 east bound.  The officers attempted to locate the subject on I-265 after he fled, driving erratically.  They located the subject's vehicle (which was stolen) on the exit ramp from I-265 to Brownsboro Rd.  Ofc. Lietz pursued the subject on foot into a wooded area.  Mr. Buckman refused officer's commands to stop.  Mr. Buckman was attempting to scale a wooden fence, when he turned abruptly with something in his hands.  Ofc. Lietz stated Mr. Buckman made a movement with his hands, which he perceived to be the manipulation of a possible weapon and thus a deadly threat.  Ofc. Lietz fired at the subject several times striking him 1 time in the leg.  Evidence at the scene determined the item in Mr. Buckman's hands to be a cigarette package containing possible narcotics, which he may have been attempting to dispose of.  The investigation was presented to the Commonwealth's Attorney's Office.  In a letter dated 3/18/2016, Assistant Commonwealth's Attorney Mark Miller opined at the time Ofc. Lietz made contact with Mr. Buckman, he had sufficient information for him to be concerned for his safety and that of other responding officers. Clearly, under the low-light situation that existed at the time, with the distance between the two, with Mr. Buckman's back to the officer, and knowing how desperate his actions were to evade the police, it was reasonable for Ofc. Lietz to interpret these actions as a threat to himself, and potentially Ofc. Godfrey, and it was reasonable to take actions necessary to defend himself.
